# Transfer learning using a NN

Training a neural network on a limited number of training examples with HUMO_LUMO gap values (the value we want to predict). We can use another much bigger dataset that has LUMO values, a value quite closely related to the HUMO_LUMO gap value - we can then use transfer learning to use this neural network to then predict the HUMO_LUMO gap values on the test dataset
